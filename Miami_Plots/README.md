# Miami Plots of brain-phenotypic associations

* The p-values (in negative decimal logarithms) for each brain-phenotypic link that passed the FDR threshold in either males or females in the phenome-wide profiling of a given mode of HC-DN co-variation can be found in [hits](https://github.com/dblabs-mcgill-mila/HCDMNCOV_AD/tree/master/Miami_Plots/hits)
* The absolute difference in association strength between males and females at a formal 5-95% population confidence interval for a given mode is shown in [plots](https://github.com/dblabs-mcgill-mila/HCDMNCOV_AD/tree/master/Miami_Plots/bootstrap_analysis/plots)
* Other information on the bootstrap distribution (e.g., mean, median, 25th and 75th percentiles) can be found in supplementary [tables](https://github.com/dblabs-mcgill-mila/HCDMNCOV_AD/tree/master/Miami_Plots/bootstrap_analysis/tables)
