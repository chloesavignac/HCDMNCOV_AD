# Miami Plots of brain-phenotypic associations

* The p-values (in negative decimal logarithms) for each brain-phenotypic link that passed the FDR threshold in either males or females in the phenome-wide profiling of a given mode of HC-DN co-variation can be found in [hits](https://github.com/dblabs-mcgill-mila/HCDMNCOV_AD/tree/master/Miami_Plots/hits)
* The absolute difference in association strength between males and females at a formal 5-95% population confidence interval for a given mode is shown in [bootstrap_analysis/plots](https://github.com/dblabs-mcgill-mila/HCDMNCOV_AD/tree/master/Miami_Plots/bootstrap_analysis/plots)
* Other information on the bootstrap distributions (e.g., mean, median, 25th and 75th percentiles) can be found in supplementary [bootstrap_analysis/tables](https://github.com/dblabs-mcgill-mila/HCDMNCOV_AD/tree/master/Miami_Plots/bootstrap_analysis/tables)
* The python code generating the bootstrap distributions is splitted in a [part 1](https://github.com/dblabs-mcgill-mila/HCDMNCOV_AD/blob/master/Miami_Plots/bootstrap_analysis/Miami_bootstrap_2022_updated_compute_canada.py) and a [part 2](https://github.com/dblabs-mcgill-mila/HCDMNCOV_AD/blob/master/Miami_Plots/bootstrap_analysis/Manhattan_Plot_bootstrap_part_2_08.27.2022.ipynb)
